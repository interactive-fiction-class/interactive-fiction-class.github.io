        "## Generating Characters and Quests\n",
        " \n",
        "For this in-class exercise, we will use the LIGHT data to try to generate interesting Non-Player Characters.  We'll do the following generation exercises:\n",
        "1. Given a location, generate possible characters who might be found there.\n",
        "2. For each character, we'll generate a name, a persona, and a quest.\n",
        "\n",
        "To generate quests, we'll use a new set of data from the Facebook AI Group that developed the LIGHT data that we used in previous assignments.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can find a description of their quest data in the paper [How to Motivate Your Dragon: Teaching Goal-Driven Agents to Speak and Act in Fantasy Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00685).  Here is the abstract for the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "> We seek to create agents that both act and communicate with other agents in pursuit of a goal. Towards this end, we extend LIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019)–a large-scale crowd-sourced fantasy text-game—with a dataset of “quests”. These contain natural language motivations paired with in-game goals and human demonstrations; completing a quest might require dialogue or actions (or both). We introduce a reinforcement learning system that (1) incorporates large-scale language modeling-based and commonsense reasoning-based pre-training to imbue the agent with relevant priors; and (2) leverages a factorized action space of action commands and dialogue, balancing between the two. We conduct zero-shot evaluations using held-out human expert demonstrations, showing that our agents are able to act consistently and talk naturally with respect to their motivations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The thing that I find exciting about this work as compared to the in-class exercise we did last week is that it will potentially allow us to add **goals** to characters to help guide their dialogue, rather than just have them perform chit-chat.\n"
