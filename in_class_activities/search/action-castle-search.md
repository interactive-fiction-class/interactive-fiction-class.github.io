In Class Activity: Search Algorithms for Action Castle
=============================================================

Today in class we will walk through how to use search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve our text adventure games like Action Castle.

In order to do so, we'll need to figure out:
1. How to represent the __state space__ for the game.
2. How to list the __possible moves__ at each turn in the game.
3. How to use each possible move to generate a __successor state__.
4. How to test whether we have reached __the goal__.


We'll implement three functions that will allow us to use BFS to find the best sequence of commands in order to complete the game that we implemented in Homework 1.

### What to do 

1. Open [{{page.materials[0].name}}]({{page.materials[0].url}}).
2. Implement the following functions:
* `get_state`
* `get_available_actions`
* `goal_test`

3. Please submit your work to [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}) by {{ page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} before {{ page.due_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }}.
