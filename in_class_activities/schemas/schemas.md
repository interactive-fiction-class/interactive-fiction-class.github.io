In Class Activity: WordNet Schemas
=============================================================

In this assignment, you will be getting hands-on experience with working with WordNet and manipulating the data.
Pretend that you (or, rather, your agent) are in the middle of playing a text adventure game. Different characters are asking for various items, but you don't have the exact items. You will be using WordNet to form schemas of your inventory items and going your representations to find the most similar item.
