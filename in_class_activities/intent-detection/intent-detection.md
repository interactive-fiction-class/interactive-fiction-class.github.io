In Class Activity: Collect Data for Intent Detection
=============================================================

Today in class you will create a set of data for **intent detection** for text adventure games.  In our first version of the Text Adventure Game, we had a simple keyword-based method of handling the player's intent.  The parser implemented a function called `get_player_intent` that took in a player's command and then decided which of the following actions a player was trying to accomplish:
* **Move** to a new location
* **Examine** an object
* **Get** an object
* **Drop** an object
* Perform a **special** action using an object
* Check the player's **inventory**
* **Redescribe** the scene
* Perform a **sequence** of actions

The Colab Notebook will guide you through creating some data that we'll use to train a model to perform intent detection, instead of using keywords. 

It'll take about 20 minutes to complete this annotation. We'll do this as an in-class activity.   If you're watching the video remotely, you can upload your annotations to gradescope anytime before {{ page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} by {{ page.due_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }}.

The results will be saved into your Google drive as a JSON file.  

### What to do

1. Open the [Colab Notebok for Collecting Intent Detection Data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/interactive-fiction-class/interactive-fiction-class.github.io/blob/master/in_class_activities/intent-detection/Collect_Intent_Detection_Data.ipynb).
2. Choose `Runtime > Run all`.
3. The Colab Notebook will ask "Permit this notebook to access your Google Drive files?".  
4. Scroll down to the "START HERE: Annotate Data" section of the notebook
5. Complete the interactive annotation activity.  It will save a JSON file to your Google drive.
6. Please submit your JSON to [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}) by {{ page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} before {{ page.due_date | date: "%I:%M%p" }}. 
7. Time permitting you can go on to the next section, "Use OpenAI For Intent Detection", which will show you how to use your intent detection data to create a prompt and how to predict the intents for previously unseen user input.
