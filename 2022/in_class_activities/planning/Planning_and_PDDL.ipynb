        "# Planning and PDDL\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook examines the use of *planning* in artifical intelligence.  We will look at a classical planning algorithm called STRIPS (Standford Research Institute Problem Solver), which uses a language for defining plans called PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language).  STRIPS, PDDL and classic planning are all defined in the Russell and Norvig textbook AI A Modern Approach, in chapter 11.  I also recommend this tutorial by Kory Becker: [Artificial Intelligence Planning with STRIPS, A Gentle Introduction](http://www.primaryobjects.com/2015/11/06/artificial-intelligence-planning-with-strips-a-gentle-introduction/).  She has an [online demo](https://stripsfiddle.herokuapp.com) that lets you upload your own PDDL-specified problems, and find solutions to them.  \n",

        "We will use this Python library:\n",
        "* [PDDL Parser](https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/pddl-parser)\n",
        "\n",
        "In PDDL, we can define **action schema** to represent actions.  Here is an example of an action schema for flying a plane from one location to another: \n",
        "```\n",
        "(:action fly\n",
        "     :parameters (?p - plane ?from - airport ?to - airport)\n",
        "     :precondition (and (plane ?p) (airport ?from) (airport ?to) (at ?p ?from))\n",
        "     :effect (and (at ?p ?to)) (not (at ?p ?from)))\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This defines an action called **fly**, which takes 3 arguments: a plane **p**, a starting airport **from** and a destination airport **to**.  In order for this action to be applied, several *preonditions* must be satisified:\n",
        "1. **p** must be a plane\n",
        "1. **from** must be be an airport\n",
        "1. **to** must be be an airport\n",
        "1. **p** must initially be located at **from**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the action is applied, then it has the *effect* of changing several states in the world.\n",
        "1. **p** is no longer located at **from** \n",
        "1. **p** is now located at **to** \n",
        "\n",
        "In general, a schema consists of:\n",
        "* an action name\n",
        "* a list of all the variables use in the schema\n",
        "* a precondition - a conjunction of literals (positive or negated atomic logical sentences)\n",
        "* an effect - a conjunction of literals\n",
        "\n",
        "_Note: The enforcement of argument types like `(plane ?p)` can be left out of the action schema if we specify types in the domain PDDL file._\n"
