Course number
: CIS 700-001 - Interactive Fiction and Text Generation 

Prerequisites 
: At least one of the following courses
: CIS 419/519
: CIS 520
: CIS 421/521
: CIS 522
: CIS 530

Course Description
: We know now that artificial intelligence (AI) can play chess or even Go, but can AI play text adventure games (also known as interactive fiction)? What about roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons? In this course, we will be looking at the subfields of automated story generation (teaching computers to tell stories), interactive fiction (teaching computers to play through stories), and their intersection (teaching computers to tell and then play through the stories). This class will teach you about computational creativity and help develop your skills in natural language processing and cognitive modeling. 

Learning Objectives
* Understanding the challenges of creating text-based games and automatically generating stories.
* Implement and appraise the value of different technologies (Neural Language Models, Dialogue Systems, Scripts, Planning, and Commonsense Reasoning) in story generation/interactive fiction playing.
* Argue for the appropriate components of a working story generation system or interactive fiction--playing system.
* Create your own story generation system or interactive fiction--playing system.




<!-- 
: This class will cover several areas.
* Text Adventure Games - How they are implemented and how we can build agents that automatically solve them.
* Common-sense Reasoning - TODO
* Narrative Understanding - Extracting narrative structure (event schemas) from text
* Text Generation - Generating natural-sounding text that follows a desired style, narrative arc, or other attribute.
* Chatbots / Dialog Systems - TODO

Grading
: There will be six homeworks and a final project. In addition, you will be required to present a paper in class.
* 10% Paper Presentation + Class Participation
* 55% Homeworks (6 in total)
* 35% Final Project

Paper Presentations
: Over the course of the semester, each student must prepare a 10-15 minute presentation on a research paper relevant to the course. Since these presentation will be a substantial component of the learning experience in the class, slides must be prepared and emailed to us at least 72 hours in advance of the lecture they will be presented in (e.g., by 3PM on the Monday before the presenation date), so that we can provide feedback on them. Failure to send us the slides ahead of time will result in a grade penalty on the presentation. 

Collaboration Policy
: Unless otherwise noted, you ARE allowed to work in pairs on the homework assignments, and teams of 3-5 for the final project.

Late Day Policy
: Each student has five free "late days".  Homeworks can be submitted at most two days late.  If you are out of late days, then you will not be able to get credit for subsequent late assignments. One "day" is defined as anytime between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline. The intent of the late day policy it to allow you to take extra time due to unforseen circumstances like illnesses or family emergencies, and for forseeable interruptions like on campus interviewing and religious holidays.  You do not need to ask permission to use your late days.  No additional late days are granted. **Late days only apply to the homeworks. They cannot be used on the final project, which must be finished by the final day of class.  Late days may not be used for paper presentations.**
