=============================================================

## Instructions

[ATOMIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00146) is a crowdsourced commonsense knowledge graph that is used for state-of-the-art commonsense reasoning tasks. In this homework, you will be working with [COMET-ATOMIC-2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05953), a BART transformer model finetuned on an updated version of the original ATOMIC. You will take the information provided to you by COMET-ATOMIC-2020 and structure it into a schema used to track the state of a story.

Go to the colab notebook link above for more information.


## What to Submit

1. An IPython notebook called `HW5_Schemas.ipynb` that runs your COMET-ATOMIC schema.
2. A document (doc/docx, txt, pdf) that has **your schema explanation and the answers to the two sets of questions** found at the end of the notebook.


Submissions should be done on [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}).

## Grading
- Code - 2 points
- Schema Diagram/Explanation - 2 points
- Story Tracking Questions - 15 points (3 pts each)
- COMET-ATOMIC Questions - 6 points (2 pts each)
