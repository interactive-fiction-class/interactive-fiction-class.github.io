## Instructions

For this homework you will re-implement your Action Castle game from [Homework 1](/homeworks/text-adventure-game/text-adventure-game.html) but in the form of a "Skill" for Amazon Alexa. You will be able to reuse a lot of the code you wrote in Homework 1, but the focus of this homework will be to implement your _intent request_ using Alexa Intents and the _Command Parser_ by creating Alexa Request Handlers. You can use the original Action Castle game, or if you want to be creative, you can implement any other interactive fiction game you would like. We will play all of your games and give full credit if there are no errors in the flow of the game. 

### Starter code

We have provided [starter code for an Alexa adventure game](https://colab.research.google.com/github/interactive-fiction-class/interactive-fiction-class.github.io/blob/master/homeworks/alexa_action_castle/lambda.zip).  You are free to modify it however you want and bring in any dependencies you feel will be useful, but do not forget to add them to `requirements.txt`.

### Definitions

Before we explain what you will be doing, there are first some Alexa-specific terms we need define.

* **Skill:** A 3rd party application for Amazon Alexa.
* **Request:** What the user is trying to accomplish when they talk to Alexa.
* **Request Handler:** The processes that send and receive requests.
* **Intent:** A schema for capturing the Request (i.e., taking a command and turning it into something Alexa can work with).
* **[Slot](https://medium.com/enpit-developer-blog/alexa-what-are-slots-and-how-to-read-slot-values-ea050047df0c):** Variables within an Intent.
* **Interaction Model:** Determines whether the current Skill can handle certain Requests.

### Setting up the Environment

Sign in to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/start?sc_category=paid&sc_channel=SEM&sc_campaign=SEM-GO%5EBrand%5EAll%5ELD%5EProfessional_Developer%5EEvergreen%5EUS%5EEnglish%5ETex&sc_publisher=GO&sc_content=content&sc_detail=571868003723&sc_funnel=convert&sc_country=US&sc_keyword=alexa%20developer%20console&sc_place=&sc_trackingcode=e&sc_segment=&sc_medium=paid%7CSEM%7CSEM-GO%5EBrand%5EAll%5ELD%5EProfessional_Developer%5EEvergreen%5EUS%5EEnglish%5ETex%7CGO%7Ccontent%7C571868003723%7Cconvert%7CUS%7Calexa%20developer%20console%7C%7Ce%7C&gclid=CjwKCAjwoduRBhA4EiwACL5RP8suprxHnexM4TslG_jvjmEYp2-lbEjkdUA-sCXTwZ2URKafzWGjshoCYREQAvD_BwE). Click on "Create Skill". Select the *Custom Model* and *Alexa Hosted (Python)* options. In the next page select the *Start from Scratch* option.  Once you create your skill, click on it and go on the `Code` tab. There you can copy and paste the template files we gave you in `lambda.zip`, or even better, you can use Python's `import` functionality. 

You should define a set of [Amazon Intents](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/interaction-model-design/design-the-custom-intents-for-your-skill.html) and implement [Request Handlers](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java/handle-requests.html) to parse them.  You may also find it useful to look into the [ASK Skills Documentation](https://alexa-skills-kit-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/core.html).

*Note:* We have implemented the "direction" Request Handler for you. You will still have to implement the Intents in the Interaction Model, but you can use the "direction" Request Handler as a guide for creating other Request Handlers. 


#### Some useful commands
* `ask_utils.is_request_type(type)(handler_input)`: checks if the Request type is equal to the input type. 
* `ask_utils.is_intent_name(name)(handler_input)`: checks if the Request Intent name is equal to the input name.
* `ask_utils.request_util.get_slot(handler_input, slot_name)`: returns an object of the Slot with name slot_name. You can use obj.value to get the string name of the Slot. 


### Debugging:
* You can use [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to debug your code. When you are in the Code tab in the Alexa developer console, you can click on CloudWatch logs to be directed on your skillâ€™s log output. 
* You can test your Skill in the *Test* tab of the console. The logs from there will be on CloudWatch. 

### Invite Beta Testers

In order to submit your code, you should invite the TAs as beta testers. [Here are the instructions](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/skills-beta-testing-for-alexa-skills.html) on how to do this. Our emails are:`artemisp@seas.upenn.edu`, `ldugan@seas.upenn.edu`. When you release a Skill for beta testing you need to complete the _Privacy and Compliance Component_. You can safely answer *no* to all those questions.  


## What to submit

You should invite the TAs to be beta testers for your Skill, as instructed in the relevant section above. You should also submit:

1. A text file called `playthrough.txt` with all of the commands that we would need to complete your game. It shold be a plain text file with one command per line.
2. A zipped folder called `lambda.zip` that contains the code for your game.

Submissions should be done on [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}).
