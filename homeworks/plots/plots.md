## Instructions

In the paper [Crowdsourcing Narrative Intelligence](http://www.cogsys.org/journal/volume2/article-2-4.pdf), Li et al. created the Scheherazade algorithm to generate plot graphs from a collection of crowdsourced stories.
Head over to the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/interactive-fiction-class/interactive-fiction-class.github.io/blob/master/homeworks/plots/HW3_plot.ipynb) for more information on what you'll be doing.

## What to Submit

1. An IPython notebook called `HW3-plot.ipynb` that runs your plot graph implementation.
2. A document (doc/docx, txt, pdf) that has your answers to the questions found at the end of the notebook.
3. **Two** graph files: one named `plotgraph.html` that is your final (initialized, pruned, & improved) plot graph using your clusters, one named `gold.html` using the clusters from Part 2.

If you decide to do the extra credit, please submit a file for that graph as well: `ec.html`. You may include your answers to the questions in your document under a section labeled "Extra Credit".

Submissions should be done on [Gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}).

## Grading
- Implementation of the Scheherazade algorithm - 15 points
- Answers to questions - 10 points
- Graph files - 5 points
- Extra Credit - 5 points
