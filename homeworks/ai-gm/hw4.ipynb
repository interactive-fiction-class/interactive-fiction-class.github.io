    "In this homework, we'll use Kani to build a simple Game Master (GM) for the [Mausritter TTRPG](https://losing-games.itch.io/mausritter). Your GM will help walk you through creating a mouse and rolling dice to overcome challenges in the game. Along the way, you'll learn the basics of the [Kani library](https://kani.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), function calling with LLMs, and how a LLM can use structured information to act as a game state manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't implement more complex systems like combat or spellcasting in this homework, but extending this system to make a more comprehensive GM (e.g. adding inventory tracking, combat, spellcasting, structured tracking of NPCs, ...) would make for a great class final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Need\n",
    "\n",
    "- A copy of the [Mausritter rules](https://losing-games.itch.io/mausritter) (available for free on itch.io)\n",
    "- Your [Helicone key](https://www.helicone.ai/developer)\n",
    "- Recommended: the [Kani documentation](https://kani.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",

    "\n",
    "First, let's install the libraries we're using and configure Kani to use the Helicone proxy. Kani requires Python 3.10 or higher - if you encounter an error saying \"No matching distribution found\", you may need to upgrade your Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, I recommend setting up a virtual environment for this homework. To set up a virtual environment, use the following terminal commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac/Linux:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3.10 -m venv ./venv\n",
    "./venv/bin/activate\n",

    "venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to restart your IDE after creating a new virtual environment for it to detect the interpreter. Now, when we install dependencies, it won't affect the global environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using VSCode, you may want to enable word wrap for your notebook so long outputs on a single line automatically fold to multiple lines. You can find the wordwrap option by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of your .ipynb file, then click \"Customize Notebook Layout\", then scroll down to the bottom of the settings and select \"Notebook Output Word Wrap\"."

For this homework, we'll use its output as Markdown, but if you're interested in a deeper dive into the library, the output is a [structured eval tree](https://d20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/expression.html).\n",

    "- `d20` means: Roll a single 20-sided die\n",
    "- `1d8` means: Roll a single 8-sided die\n",
    "- `3d6` means: Roll three 6-sided dice, add them together\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain circumstances, you'll need to roll some dice and keep only the N highest (e.g. 4d6, keep highest 3). `d20` expresses this in \"keep-highest\" notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `4d6kh3` means: Roll four six-sided dice, add the highest three together\n",
    "- `2d20kl1` means: Roll two d20s, keep the lower (\"disadvantage\" in D&D, \"advantage\" in Mausritter)\n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples, check out [the documentation](https://d20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start.html#examples). Try running this cell a couple times to see what the result of these rolls are! Feel free to add more rolls to experiment, too."
