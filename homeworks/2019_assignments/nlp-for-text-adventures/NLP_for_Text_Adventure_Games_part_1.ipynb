        "In this notebook, we start trying to improve the coverage of the parser in a text adventure game like Action Castle.  The parser is responsible for interpreting the players' input.  A limitation of classic text adventure games was that parsers were able to handle only a limited number of keywords, and did not support the wide range of different ways that it is possible to say a command.  This is one of the key components that makes natural language challenging for computers to handle.\n",

        "In part 1, we will introduce you to the WordNet resource.  WordNet is a classic resource for natural language processing.  It was created at Princeton University by Chrstine Fellbaum and Geroge Miller.  It encodes information about synonyms, antonyms, and is-a relationships between words like _troll_ is-a _monster_.  In NLP, is-a relationships are called hypernyms or hyponyms."
