Participation Activity: Research Our Guest Speaker
=============================================================

We'll have several guest speakers this semester, including game designers, AI professors and industrial researchers.  For each speaker, you should learn a bit about them before they give their talk, and prepare at least one question that you'd like us to ask them to hear their insights about our course topics. 

You should [submit your question to gradescope]({{page.submission_link}}), along with a short bio for the speaker and the websites that you used to research them  before class begins.

On {{ page.due_date | date: "%A, %B %-d, %Y" }} our guest speaker will be **{{ page.speaker }}**.
